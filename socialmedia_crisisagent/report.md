The final status is: ESCALATE 

The reasoning is based on the wave 2 tweet data, which shows that the situation is worsening. Tweet 005 from @CNN_Breaking indicates that health officials are now investigating NovaBrew Coffee, and the company's response is being criticized as generic and inadequate. Tweet 006 from @angry_customer_99 and Tweet 007 from @sarah_drinks further emphasize the public's dissatisfaction with the company's handling of the crisis. The number of likes and retweets for these tweets is significant, indicating a high level of engagement and attention to the issue.

Next steps for the PR team: 

1. Immediately draft a more detailed and apologetic statement addressing the public's concerns and outlining the company's plan to investigate and resolve the quality issues.
2. Engage with health officials and relevant authorities to ensure cooperation and transparency in the investigation.
3. Provide regular updates on the investigation's progress and any actions taken to prevent similar incidents in the future.
4. Consider taking concrete steps to regain customer trust, such as offering refunds or compensation to those affected, and implementing additional quality control measures to prevent similar incidents.
